Being free is when you are able to stand up and speak in public spewing your beliefs not caring what anyone else will think of them. \n\nBeing free is when you are able to go against the grain, when you are able to make a left when everyone else is going right, and not worry about why everyone is talking about you, or looking at you in a manner that is unfavorable, and with faces that blatantly say that they don't approve of your choices. \n\nOne of the greatest challenges is being yourself in a world that's trying to make you like everyone else.","university_name":"СПбГУ","tv":"","last_name":"Дуров","universities":[{"id":1,"name":"СПбГУ","graduation":2006,"city":2,"country":1}],"faculty":0}
